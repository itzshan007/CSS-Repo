            "Later, both Zenos hold the Tournament of Power, where teams of fighters from eight of the twelve universes battle, with defeated universes being erased.
            Goku, his friends, Android 17, and a temporarily revived Freeza join the tournament.
            They battle formidable warriors, such as Universe 11's Jiren.
            Goku attains a new form known as Ultra Instinct, allowing him to fight unconsciously.
            The tournament ends with Goku and Freeza eliminating Jiren along with themselves, leaving Android 17 as the winner for Universe 7. 
            He is awarded one wish from the Super Dragon Balls, and restores the erased universes. Freeza is permanently revived.
